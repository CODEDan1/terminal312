# Why I did this.
Command Prompt is very helpful (especially when coding) however, the commands are.. a bit complicated, so I decided (using win32 API) to create my first ever project, a more user-friendly cmd..
# Terminal312!!
I made this terminal to do most of the things normal command prompt does, but more english-like, since it really isn't much, this is an open-source, brand-new terminal!! :D (Be sure to read keys.md to learn how to use.)
